Heads-up is intelligent, integrated, web-based business management software designed to work your way.</li>\r\n\r\n<li> Configured. We configure it to your business and processes so you can work faster and smarter, and know you’re working more profitably.</li>\r\n\r\n<li> Easy. Heads-up is an easy complement to your team’s day-to-day work. Seamless integration of your business processes means you’ll save time, gain insight and more easily manage and control your operations.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul> <li> Simplicity. Heads-up is simple to deploy and offers easy access and intuitive processes for your team.</li>\r\n<li> Single-entry efficiency. Heads-up links functions such as time reporting with project planning. You only enter data once and Heads-up takes it from there. This saves time and improves client account management. It syncs with your accounting software to guarantee a single source of truth.\r\n<li> Web-based accessibility. All users can access Heads-up at all times via secure logins and based on their level of authority. With a web-based system you, and they, can effectively go anywhere and keep doing business.</li>\r\n<li> Real-time data. Gain fast access to reports on the time your team is investing right through your business’ value-chain. This helps you improve your capacity planning, your business development pipeline, and project and revenue management.</li>\r\n<li>Quality control. Each module is backed by a workflow-based quality control process. This includes clear delegations, approvals and accountability and gives you rapid precision and greater confidence in your business data.</li>\r\n<li>Profit-centre reports. Reports highlight profitability at various levels of your business, including staff capacity and business development conversion rates.</li>\r\n<li>Automation. Heads-up complements and interfaces with accounting software and automates processes between the two. For example, the creation of a new employee record in your accounting system sets them up in Heads-up; and the creation of a new project in Heads-up triggers a new accounting job number.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who is it for?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional services firms that want to bill their time rather than spend it managing their business.</p>\r\n\r\n"},"seo":{"title":"Heads-up is intelligent, integrated, web-based business management software designed to work your wa","keywords":"Business Management, Office Management, Practice Management, Timesheets, Professional Services, Invoicing, Backlog, Scheduling, Consulting, Engineering, Environmental, Architecture, Building, Expense Claims, Leave Tracking, Financial Reporting, Subcontract Management","description":"Heads-up is intelligent, integrated, web-based business management software designed to work your wa"},"urls":{"support":"","landing":"http://www.heads-up.com.au/"},"images":{"logo":"/media/logo_override/headsup_logo_1.JPG","hero":{"url":"/media/hero/headsup_hero.jpg","caption":""},"pictures":[{"image":{"url":"/media/listing_media/headsup_hero6.JPG","caption":"Hero5"}}],"videos":[{"video":{"url":"http://vimeo.com/60219532","caption":""}}]},"price":{"type":"ss","cost":"None","comments":"Per User Licence or Site Licence models avaialble"},"date_added":"Oct. 1, 2013","certified":{"status":false},"categories":[{"category":{"id":"19","name":"Time Tracking and Rostering"}}],"workswith":[{"application":{"id":"4","name":"AccountRight Classic","icon":"/media/workswith_icons/arc_2.png"}}],"tags":[{"tag":"Architecture"}]},{"id":"13","listing_order":64290,"is_promoted":false,"name":"BudgetLink","status":"active","version":"3.41","url":"/addons/listing/13/budgetlink","developer":{"id":"9","level":"PP","type":"Premium Developer Partner","dates":{"listed":"May 26, 2014","approved":""},"name":"Accounting Addons","slug":"accounting-addons","blog":"","facebook":"","twitter":"@AccountingAddon","logo":"/media/logos/accountingaddons.png","url":"http://accountingaddons.com.au/","description":"Accounting Addons specialises in Excel based add-on solutions that extend MYOB.\r\n","seo":{"title":"Accounting Addons specialises in Excel based add-on solutions that extend MYOB.","keywords":"Accounting Addons specialises in Excel based add-on solutions that extend MYOB.\r\n","description":"Accounting Addons specialises in Excel based add-on solutions that extend MYOB."},"contact":{"email":"enquiries@accountingaddons.com.au","phone":"+61 1300 233 667","phone_aus":"1300 233 667","phone_nz":""},"certified":{"status":false},"google_analytics":"UA-47966726-1"},"description":{"summary":"FREE - Monthly Job Budgets, Cash Flow Forecasts, Data File Consolidations & Board Reports","full":"<p>Automates<br />\r\n<ul><li>Monthly Job Budgets</li>\r\n<li>Cash Flow Forecasts</li>\r\n<li>Consolidated Financials</li>\r\n<li>Excel Board Reports</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All for FREE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sound Familiar?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an Adviser or Finance Manager reporting to a Board with MYOB, you have used MS Excel; either to <strong>analyse Monthly Budgets by Job or Category, Forecast Cash Flow, Consolidate Data Files or create Custom Board or Management Reports.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt you would have created professional templates, amended them with new accounts or jobs, fixed broken formulas and at least once each reporting period, exported reports, copied and pasted data and checked for errors.

The lead indicators are designed to give management time to see and ‘step-in’ if there is a problem, before the impact is felt on the financial statements (lag indicators). Areas such as client and staff satisfaction, sales and rework can all be monitored. Our experience tells us that if ‘lead indicators’ are measured and managed, the ‘lag indicators’ take care of themselves.\"\r\n"},"seo":{"title":"A cloud based business intelligence suite that uses sophisticated performance measurement and assessment tools, providing quick, visual reports","keywords":"analysis, measure, monitor, financial, business performance, KPI","description":"A cloud based business intelligence suite that uses sophisticated performance measurement and assessment tools, providing quick, visual reports"},"urls":{"support":"http://www.analysis-one.com/contact.aspx","landing":"http://www.analysis-one.com/"},"images":{"logo":"/media/logos/Logo_Crowe_Horwath_150x150.jpg","hero":{"url":"/media/","caption":""},"pictures":[{}],"videos":[{}]},"price":{"type":"ss","cost":"None","comments":""},"date_added":"May 2, 2014","certified":{"status":false},"categories":[{"category":{"id":"15","name":"Business Intelligence"}}],"workswith":[{"application":{"id":"6","name":"AccountRight Live","icon":"/media/workswith_icons/arl_2.png"}}],"tags":[{}]},{"id":"119","listing_order":20812,"is_promoted":false,"name":"Abtrac","status":"active","version":"","url":"/addons/listing/119/abtrac","developer":{"id":"82","level":"PP","type":"Premium Developer Partner","dates":{"listed":"Feb. 28, 2014","approved":""},"name":"Abtrac","slug":"abtrac","blog":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","logo":"/media/logos/abtrac.jpg","url":"http://www.abtrac.com.au/","description":"<p>The Abtrac business began in 1990 with a focus on consulting and software development along with helping clients with technology based solutions as they realised their newly acquired PC's could do more for them an their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the 90's an in-house time recording system was developed to track our internal ever-growing band of employees.

The column headings can be whatever is convenient or happens to drop out of the originating system, or it can work by column numbers. For Item sales you need the MYOB Item number, quantity and either the price or the line total.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively you can set up mappings that cover every possible field in MYOB so you can import values for invoice number, PO number, freight and shipping details, line description, payment details and more.</p>\r\n<p>If your sales may be to new customers, use a customer mapping import to create the missing customer cards first. All you need is a customer name or CardID column to create a card and these could even come straight out of the same file as the sales. Again you can map any other fields so if your data includes address, phone number or email address these can be imported too.</p>\r\n<h2>What TransPost imports</h2>\r\n<p>TransPost can import these data types into your MYOB AccountRight company file.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Customer cards (import and update)</li>\r\n    <li>Sales (with line item details if required)</li>\r\n    <li>Item details (import and update)</li>\r\n    <li>Customer payments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All types of sale layout can be used as there is a simple interface for mapping data from data file fields to MYOB AccountRight fields.</p>\r\n<p>TransPost includes comprehensive error logging, It creates an import report file corresponding to each imported file recording all changes made to your  MYOB AccountRight company file so you have a full record of what it has done.</p>\r\n<h2>Batch Importing</h2>\r\n<p>An ordered sequence of mappings can be created so all files in specified folders can be processed through a sequence of mappings with one button click. When files are processed they can be moved to other folders. Failed data is recorded separately to facilitate correction and retry.</p>\r\n<p>For example a customer mapping may be used to import the new customers in a set of files and move those files into the input folder for a sales mapping which will then import the sales. Then all you need to do is drop your input files in the first folder and click the TransPost “Run All Now” button and the whole lot gets processed.</p>\r\n<p>The TransPost Service may be set up to import automatically when data arrives in the specified folders.</p>\r\n  \r\n"},"seo":{"title":"Import sales into MYOB from text files as output by your own e-commerce or database system","keywords":"Sales import, import sales, import invoices, import data into MYOB","description":"Import sales into MYOB from text files as output by your own e-commerce or database system"},"urls":{"support":"","landing":"http://www.transpost.com.au/"},"images":{"logo":"/media/logo_override/transpost_logo2.JPG","hero":{"url":"/media/hero/transpost_hero2.jpg","caption":""},"pictures":[{"image":{"url":"/media/listing_media/transpost_hero1_1.jpg","caption":"Hero2"}}],"videos":[{}]},"price":{"type":"ss","cost":"None","comments":"$192.50 p.a."},"date_added":"May 28, 2013","certified":{"status":false},"categories":[{"category":{"id":"22","name":"Data Synchronisation"}}],"workswith":[{"application":{"id":"4","name":"AccountRight Classic","icon":"/media/workswith_icons/arc_2.png"}}],"tags":[{"tag":"csv"}]},{"id":"50","listing_order":62338,"is_promoted":false,"name":"JobsPlus","status":"active","version":"","url":"/addons/listing/50/jobsplus","developer":{"id":"41","level":"PP","type":"Premium Developer Partner","dates":{"listed":"June 13, 2013","approved":""},"name":"GSN Solutions P/L","slug":"gsn-solutions-pl","blog":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","logo":"/media/","url":"http://www.jobsplus.net.au/","description":"JobsPlus is committed to helping companies solve their business problems by providing the tools to improve productivity, increase profitability and streamline business operations.\r\n\r\nThe JobsPlus client base varies from small business through to mid-market corporations, and includes many different industries such as the Glass Industry, Electrical, Engineering, Automotive, Plumbing, Fire Protection, Air Conditioning, and many more.
